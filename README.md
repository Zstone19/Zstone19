### Hi! I'm Zach Stone, an Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Most of the work I'm doing currently involves time-series and spectral analysis of AGN data. This involves a number of different topics:
* AGN time-series analysis
* spectral analysis
* reverberation mapping
* dynamical modeling
* imaging reduction
* AGN sample studies

I'm making a number of packages to help with this analysis, so feel free to look around and use anything you like.

If you want to reach out, you can email me at stone28@illinois.edu.
