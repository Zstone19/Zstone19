### Hey there, looks like you found something interesting

Most of the work I'm doing currently involves time-series and spectral analysis of AGN data. This could involve a number of different topics:
* AGN time-series analysis
* spectral analysis
* reverberation mapping
* image decomposition
* AGN sample studies

I'm making a number of packages to help with this analysis too, so feel free to look around and use anything you like.

If you want to reach out, you can email me at stone28@illinois.edu.
